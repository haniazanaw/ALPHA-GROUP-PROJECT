            <p>Even amidst the storms of struggle, unity provides a beacon of hope and strength. By finding common
                ground and<br> collaborating, we can navigate challenging times together, building resilience and
                finding solace in shared adversity.<br> The power of unity lies not just in overcoming difficulties,
                but in the bonds of connection it forges.

                    resilience, and service. My journey has been shaped by both challenges and hope growing up in a
                    large family, facing the impacts of war, and still choosing to move forward with strength and
                    vision.<br><br> I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, especially in
                    under-resourced communities. That's why I dedicate time each week to self-study, community service,
                    and learning about sustainable energy and innovation. I believe knowledge should uplift, and I want
                    to be part of building a future where access, education, and technology go hand in hand.<br><br>
                    Each step I take, no matter how hard or slow, is part of a bigger dream to become not just skilled
                    technologist, but a force for good in my community and beyond. </p>

                <p>I'm Hani, a passionate and curious software engineering student who trives on<br> exploration and
                    hands-on learning. I love diving into new technologies , experimenting with tools and , figuring
                    things out by building, breaking and, rebuilding. For me, learning happens best when I'm actively
                    engaged, not just reading about code, but creating with it.<br><br> One of my core habits is setting
                    weekly challenges for myself like building a small app, solving a set of algorithm problems, or
                    contributing to an open-source project. These personal goals keep me sharp and motivated. I also
                    keep a digital log of what I learn each week, which helps me track progress and stay
                    inspired<br><br> Outside of tech, I make time for things that fuel my curiosity like documentaries,
                    learning new languages, and connecting with people from different backgrounds. These experiences
                    shape how I think and code, helping me build software that's not only functional but also inclusive
                    and globally aware.</p>

                <p>I'm a focused and detail-oriented software engineering student who believes that consistency and
                    precision are keys to success. I'm someone who pays attention to the little thingsin code, in
                    design, and in how people work together. I take pride in writing clean, readable code and in
                    understanding systems fromthe inside out.<br><br> One of my strongest habits is daily review and
                    revision. Each evening, I go over what I've learned, refactor a bit of old code, or revisit a
                    problem I didn't fully solve.It's my way of reinforcing knowledge and getting a bit better each day.
                    I also enjoy creating organized study plans and sticking to them, structure helpsme stay on track
                    without feeling overwhelmed.<br><br> Outside the classroom, I love organizing coding study groups
                    and helping others troubleshoot. Teaching and collaborating have become habits too. </p>
